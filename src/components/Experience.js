              identity governance solutions using SailPoint IdentityIQ. I played a key role in 
              onboarding applications into the platform by integrating connectors like Active Directory(AD), 
              Oracle Unified Directory (OUD), JDBC, and Web Services. My responsibilities included configuring
              aggregation jobs, defining identity lifecycle policies, and developing automated provisioning and 
              deprovisioning workflows.
              I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to define access certifications, 
              streamline role-based access controls (RBAC), and support compliance with audit requirements.
              Additionally, I contributed to internal framework enhancements, policy enforcement, 
              and testing automation. My efforts helped strengthen the organization's access management 
              capabilities while improving operational efficiency through secure automation."
